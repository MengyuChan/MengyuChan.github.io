			<h5>Relationship Between Cognitive Bias and Expertise</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#VisualAnalytics #CognitiveBias #InteractiveVisualization</div>
			<p>
				Domain expertise plays a significant role in visual data analysis. In the best case, domain expertise allows people to effectively guide analyses
				based on prior experiences. However, a lack of domain expertise can sometimes lead people to fail to recognize their actual performance when making decisions.
				In this project, we aim to replicate a cognitive bias- Dunning-Kruger (D-K) Effect in visual decision making. The D-K effect refers to a phenomenon
				in which unskilled people tend to overestimate their performance in certain tasks, while skilled people are inclined to underestimate their performance.
				Besides, we also investigate the behavioral patterns behind this cognitive bias by analyzing interaction logs collected during the user’s task, by using
				well-known machine learning algorithms. Check later for more publications!
				<br><br>
				As a <b>lead-author</b> of this project, my contributions included evaluating research ideas, designing experiments to detect this bias in the context of visualization,
				implementing the interface used in the task, conducting a user study, quantitatively analyzing the results, and writing the paper.

			<h5>Characterizing User Engagement Within an Online Health-related Community</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#InteractionPatterns #OnlineHealthCommunity #SocialNetworkAnalysis</div>
			<p>

				Online health communities (OHCs) are vital platforms for people to share experiences,
				seek health information, and exchange support. Existing work has examined the interaction between moderators or discussion facilitators and participants,
				in OHCs by analyzing the content of communication. But content exchange is only a part of interaction. For this, we employ a combination of
				content analysis and social network analysis to explore moderator and participant interaction patterns within VOCALE, a health-related online
				community designed to facilitate health management and problem-solving in people age 65 and older experiencing bothersome age-related symptoms
				such as fatigue, weakness, and walking difficulty. In this project, we aim to address three research questions: (1) What kinds of informational and support interactions did members of the
				online community provide one another? (2) What is the  relationship between informational interactions and
				social network structure? (3) what role did moderators play and how did they affect participants’ information behavior with VOCALE?
				<br><br>
				As a <b>lead-author</b> of this project, my contributions included evaluating research ideas, quantitatively and quantitatively analyzing the results, as well as writing the paper.

			<h5>Synthesizing Design Space of Belief-Driven Visualizations</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#BeliefDrivenVisualizations #VisualizationTheory #DataScience</div>
			<p>

				The process of forming, expressing, and updating beliefs from data plays a critical role in data-driven decision making. Eliciting
				those beliefs effectively has potential for high impact across a broad set of applications, including increased engagement with
				data and visualizations, personalizing visualizations, and understanding users’ visual reasoning processes which can inform
				improved data analysis and decision making strategies, e.g., via bias mitigation. Recently, belief-driven visualizations have
				been used to elicit and visualize readers’ beliefs in a visualization alongside data in narrative media and data journalism
				platforms such as the New York Times and FiveThityEight. However, there is little research on different aspects that constitute
				designing an effective belief-driven visualizatiton. For example, there is no systematic guidance for visualization designers on
				what design dimensions they should consider.
				In this work, we aim to construct a design space for belief-driven visualizations based on formative and summative interviews to guide the design process.
				Check later for more publications!
				<br><br>
				As a <b>core member</b> of this project, my contributions included collecting examples related to belief elicitation from news outlets and leading to code
				these examples within our proposed design framework as well as writing the paper.

<!--			<h5>Feedback Exchange and Online Affinity</h5>-->
<!--			<div class = "project_hashtag">#Feedback #CreativitySupport #ConnectedLearning #Fanfiction</div>-->
<!--			<p>-->
<!--			Feedback is a critical piece of the creative process. However, creators run into socio-psychological challenges when engaging in online critique exchange with people they have never met. In this study, we step back and take a different approach to investigate the space of online feedback by casting our attention to creators in online affinity spaces, where feedback exchange happens naturally as part of the interest-driven participatory culture. We interviewed 29 fanfiction writers and identified distinct feedback practices specific for different stages of creativity and unpack the socio-emotional needs around feedback in each stage. Our results emphasize affinity and trusting relationships in feedback exchange and map out the amateur creator’s journey in building up those relationships. Check later for more publications! -->

<!--			<div class = "project_hashtag">#DataScience #ComputationalNotebooks #OnlineCommunity #Kaggle</div>-->
<!--			<p>-->
<!--				Knowledge building is a prevalent feature in open online systems, but it is challenging to motivate participants to contribute and to maintain quality in their contributions. In the context of Kaggle, an online data science community where community knowledge is curated in the form of shared computational notebooks, we explored how competitions could be used as a potential design model to incentivize contribution. By interviewing 14 Kaggle participants, we found that competitive mechanisms could be used to motivate experts to contribute to shared knowledge, but could create challenges for beginners to do so. We offered design implications for effectively implementing competitive mechanisms that could benefit both expert and beginner participants in future knowledge building systems.-->

<!--			<h5>Feedback Seeking in Online Creative Community</h5>-->
<!--			<div class = "project_hashtag">#Feedback #CreativitySupport #OnlineDiscussion</div>-->
<!--			<p>-->
<!--				Creative workers frequently turn to online critique communities for feedback on their work. While past research has focused primarily on how to yield better feedback from providers, less is known about the strategies feedback seekers use to engage providers and request feedback. In this study, we took a mixed-method approach to study how creators publicly request feedback in an online critique community. We first identified creators’ strategies to request feedback in the community through 12 interviews with members of r/design_critiques. We then performed qualitative and computational analyses on requests and feedback posts to investigate the effectiveness of the strategies. We offered design implications for future online feedback systems.-->

<!--			<p>-->
<!--			In 2017, my team and I developed Plug-N-Talk, a smartphone application prototype that serves as an affordable solution to the pricey hearing aids market. By using our app, a pair of earphones and a microphone, users can enjoy a real-time in person conversation with background noises effectively reduced. Users can also easily adjust the enhancement of specific frequencies according to their hearing needs. -->
<!--			This project was part of UCSD Design Competition: Design for Senior Citizens in 2017. I worked as the leading UX researcher along with other 8 inspiring students. We spent 20+ hours observing in a retirement community, and interviewed a group of seniors. We regularly followed-up with a senior member of the community and studied difficulties and needs in her daily life using a rapid ethnographic approach. We identified the problem that current hearing aids on market are all very pricy, and usually cannot meet the user's needs for reduced background noise during conversations and enhancement for a specific frequency band of sound. We held brainstorming sessions with seniors and tested our low-fidelity prototype in a wizard-of-oz fashion. The final high-fi product, an ios app prototype equipped with a pair of earphones and a microphone, is the result of countless iterations and coordination between the design team and the engineering team.-->
